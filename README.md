# Job Posting Search Engine

This project is a job postings application that allows users to add new job postings and search for existing ones. It consists of a frontend built with React and Vite, and a backend built with FastAPI.


## Features

- **Job Postings Search**: Allows users to search for job postings based on keywords. Results are ranked by relevance.
- **Job Postings Upload**: Upload job postings in CSV format. The backend processes and stores them for searching.
- **Lexicon & Index Generation**: Automatically generates a lexicon and both forward and inverted indexes to speed up the search process.
- **Ranking System**: Job postings are ranked according to their relevance based on the userâ€™s search query.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggle to switch between light and dark modes in the UI for user convenience.
